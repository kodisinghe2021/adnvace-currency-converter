# Currency Converter App

A Flutter-based Currency Converter application that allows users to:

- Add customizable currency conversion cards.
- Set a base currency.
- Automatically update other currencies based on the selected base currency.

## Features

- **Dynamic Currency Cards**: Add or remove conversion cards for various currencies.
- **Base Currency Selection**: Choose a base currency, and the app recalculates all other currencies automatically.
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically fetch updated exchange rates.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for a seamless user experience.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kodisinghe2021/advance-currency-converter.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd currency-converter
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Dependencies

This project uses the following Flutter packages:

- `dio`: For fetching exchange rates.
- `getx`: For state management.

To install the dependencies, run:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

## How It Works

1. **Add Currency Cards**:
   - Tap the "+" button to add a new currency conversion card.
   - Select the desired currency from the list.

2. **Set Base Currency**:
   - Select a currency as the base.
   - All other currencies will automatically update their values based on the base currency.

3. **Fetch Exchange Rates**:
   - The app fetches real-time exchange rates to ensure accurate conversions.

## API Integration

This app uses a currency exchange API to fetch real-time rates. Replace the API URL and key in the code with your own credentials:

```dart
const String apiUrl = "https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/";
const String apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for historical exchange rates.
- Implement offline mode with cached data.
- Provide graphing features for exchange rate trends.
- Enable localization for multiple languages.
